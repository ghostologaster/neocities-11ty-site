## stanza 1

[采采卷耳，不盈頃筐。嗟我懷人，寘彼周行]{lang="zh-Hant"}

- [Waley]{.sc}: *Thick grows the cocklebur; but even a shallow basket I did not fill. Sighing for the man I love, I laid it there on the road.*
- [Karlgren]{.sc}: *I gather the* küan-er *plant, but it does not fill my slanting basket; I am sighing for my beloved one; I place it here on the road of Chou.*

[1.1](#1-1){style="font-family:var(--monospace);"}{id="1-1"}{class="section-head"}&emsp;Off the bat the translations differ in the first line, with Waley giving "thick grows \[the plant\]", and Karlgren "I gather \[the plant\]". This is due to different interpretations of the word [采采]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*tsʰˤəʔ-tsʰˤəʔ]{.IPA}. Karlgren follows the Máo gloss: [采采，事采之也]{lang="zh-Hant"} "[\*tsʰˤəʔ-tsʰˤəʔ]{.IPA} means 'to apply oneself to gathering it'". According to M. the word [采采]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*tsʰˤəʔ-tsʰˤəʔ]{.IPA} is a reduplicative form of the verb [\*tsʰˤəʔ]{.IPA}, "pick, gather"; also in Shī 8 there is [采采芣苢，薄言采之]{lang="zh-Hant"} (W.: "thick grows the plantain; Here we go plucking it"; K.: "we gather the plantain, we gather it"), with M. gloss [采采，非一辭也]{lang="zh-Hant"} "[\*tsʰˤəʔ-tsʰˤəʔ]{.IPA} is a word that means 'not singly' (?)"—this is generally taken to mean that [\*tsʰˤəʔ-tsʰˤəʔ]{.IPA} is [\*tsʰˤəʔ]{.IPA} more than once; i.e. the redup. serves some iterative function. This has been the traditional explanation since the Hàn dynasty. 

This interpretation has nevertheless been met with objection since 18 c. One complication is given by the varied glosses of this word—or at least this orthographic form—in the Máo recension of *Shījīng*. In Shī 129 there is [蒹葭蒼蒼]{lang="zh-Hant"} (W.: "thick grow the rush leaves"; K.: "the reeds and rushes are very green") in the first stanza, [蒹葭萋萋]{lang="zh-Hant"} (W.: "close grow the rush leaves"; K.: "the reeds and rushes are luxuriant") in 2nd st., and [蒹葭采采]{lang="zh-Hant"} (W: "very fresh are the rush leaves"; K.: "the reeds and rushes are full of colour") in 3rd st. with M. glosses [蒼蒼，盛也]{lang="zh-Hant"} "[\*tsʰˤaŋ-tsʰˤaŋ]{.IPA} means "luxuriant\[ly growing\]", [萋萋，猶蒼蒼也]{lang="zh-Hant"} "[\*tsʰˤəj-tsʰˤəj]{.IPA} is like [\*tsʰˤaŋ-tsʰˤaŋ]{.IPA}", and [采采，猶萋萋也]{lang="zh-Hant"} "[\*tsʰˤəʔ-tsʰˤəʔ]{.IPA} is like [\*tsʰˤəj-tsʰˤəj]{.IPA}". Here, then, [采采]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*tsʰˤəʔ-tsʰˤəʔ]{.IPA} is not related to [\*tsʰˤəʔ]{.IPA} "pick, gather" at all, but on its own a reduplicative binom ^[I use the term "binom" to mean "disyllabic morpheme".] with the meaning "luxuriant".

In Shī 150 yet one more instance of this word is found: [蜉蝣之翼，采采衣服]{lang="zh-Hant"} (W.: "wing-sheaths of the mayfly—clothes so bright and gay"; K.: "the wings of the ephemera—how colourful are the clothes!"), which M. glosses as "numerous, many" ([采采，眾多也]{lang="zh-Hant"}), though we have a third-hand record that the Hán [韓]{lang="zh-Hant"} school of the Shī glossed this as [盛也]{lang="zh-Hant"} "luxuriant\[ly coloured\]" (see Dīng 1940)—that is, the same as Máo's gloss in Shī 129. 

Suspicion has been repeatedly raised since 18 c. that the [采采]{lang="zh-Hant"} in Shī 3 and 8 are the same as that in 129 and 150, i.e. a binom meaning "luxuriant" (in 150 at least conceivably > "numerous", but not necessarily). What makes the above more than suspicion, and what I think is the *coup de grâce* to the Máo-traditional reading, is the observation that the construction intended by Máo has no grammatical parallel in *Shījīng*: in *Shījīng* elsewhere, whenever such a reduplicative binom immediately precedes a nominal item, the former is always a modifier of the latter. An elucidation of this exegetic minutia is made in Dīng Shēngshù [丁聲樹]{lang="zh-Hant"} (1940, in Literary Chinese), *Shī Juǎn-Ěr, Fǒuyǐ "cǎicǎi" shuō* <span style="text-decoration:wavy underline;">詩</span>&thinsp;<span style="text-decoration:wavy underline;">卷耳</span>、<span style="text-decoration:wavy underline;">芣苢</span>「采采」說 (this essay can be found in the collection of Dīng's [Complete Works](https://search.worldcat.org/title/1159569259)). On this point W.'s translation is perhaps more precise in meaning; K. has the point of sticking to the traditional reading.

[1.2](#1-2){style="font-family:var(--monospace);"}{id="1-2"}{class="section-head"}&emsp;[頃筐]{lang="zh-Hant"}, usually taken straightforwardly as [頃]{lang="zh-Hant"} \[[\*kʷʰeŋ]{.IPA}, "slanted, tilted"\] + [筐]{lang="zh-Hant"} \[[\*kʷʰaŋ]{.IPA}, "basket"\]; should be the name of a particular type of basket. M. gloss: [頃筐，畚屬，易盈之器也]{lang="zh-Hant"} "[\*kʷʰeŋ-kʷʰaŋ]{.IPA} is the same kind as [\*pˤənʔ]{.IPA} \[also a kind of basket\]; it is a vessel that is easily filled up", hence must have been W.'s "shallow basket".

## stanzas 2, 3

[陟彼崔嵬，我馬虺隤。我姑酌彼金罍，維以不永懷。
陟彼高岡，我馬玄黃。我姑酌彼兕觥，維以不永傷]{lang="zh-Hant"}

- [Waley]{.sc}: *I am climbing that rocky hill, my horses stagger, and I stop for a little to drink from that bronze ewer, to still my heart’s yearning. / I am climbing that high ridge, my horses are sick and spent, and I stop for a little while to drink from that horn cup, to still my heart’s pain.*
- [Karlgren]{.sc}: *I ascend that craggy height, my horses are all exhausted; meanwhile I pour out a cup from that bronze* lei-*vase, in order not to yearn all the time. / I ascend that high ridge, my horses become black and yellow; meanwhile I pour out a cup from that* kuang-*vase of rhinoceros (horn), in order not to be pained all the time.*

[2.1](#2-1){style="font-family:var(--monospace);"}{id="2-1"}{class="section-head"}&emsp;In the version found on the Ānhuī University Bamboo slips [安大簡]{lang="zh-Hant"} (from the Chǔ [楚]{lang="zh-Hant"} state in the Warring States period) these two stanzas are in the opposite order to that of the Máo text. This of course does not affect the whole picture too much. The same excavated version has [維以永懷]{lang="zh-Hant"}, [維以永傷]{lang="zh-Hant"} etc. instead of [維以不永懷]{lang="zh-Hant"}, etc., which I can't really make sense of—probably a scribal mistake?

[2.2](#2-2){style="font-family:var(--monospace);"}{id="2-2"}{class="section-head"}&emsp;[崔嵬]{lang="zh-Hant"} is the familiar reduplicative binom [\*dzˤuj-ŋˤuj]{.IPA}, usually glossed as "steep; high". In this Shī [崔嵬]{lang="zh-Hant"} is used nominally (W. "rocky hill", K. "craggy height"). The M. gloss says [崔嵬，土山之戴石者]{lang="zh-Hant"} "[\*dzˤuj-ŋˤuj]{.IPA} is the kind of earthen hills with rocks on top". A totally reduplicative form of the first element [\*dzˤuj-dzˤuj]{.IPA} ([崔崔]{lang="zh-Hant"}) "steep, high" is found in Shī 101; the first element [\*dzˤuj]{.IPA} is phonologically close to the synonymous items [\*dzut]{.IPA} ([崒]{lang="zh-Hant"}, Shī 193) and [\*dzruŋ]{.IPA} ([崇]{lang="zh-Hant"}, Shī 291)—all "steep, high"; the etymological relationship, if there is any at all, is unclear. Further note other semantically and phonologically related items, most of which first attested in Hàn (first attestations earlier than Hàn are noted), e.g. [\*dzˤaj-ŋˤaj]{.IPA} ([嵯峨]{lang="zh-Hant"}), [\*dzˤat-ŋˤat]{.IPA}? ([嶻嶭]{lang="zh-Hant"}), [\*ŋˤram-dzrˤam]{.IPA} ([巉巖]{lang="zh-Hant"}; in Sòng Yù [宋玉]{lang="zh-Hant"} ca. 319&ndash;298 [BCE]{.sc}{.translower}, *Gāotáng Fù* [高唐賦]{lang="zh-Hant"}), [\*dzew-ŋˤew]{.IPA} ([嶕嶢]{lang="zh-Hant"}), [\*loŋʔ-tsˤoŋʔ]{.IPA} ([嵱嵷]{lang="zh-Hant"}; redup. < [\*tsˤoŋʔ]{.IPA}?); particularly concerning the second element of this binom there is further [\*ŋuj-ŋuj]{.IPA} ([巍巍]{lang="zh-Hant"}; in *Lúnyǔ*), [\*ʔˤruj-ŋˤuj]{.IPA} ([崴嵬]{lang="zh-Hant"}), [\*kʰrujʔ]{.IPA} ([巋]{lang="zh-Hant"}; in *Zhuāngzǐ*). I have literally no idea what's going on here, as is usually the case with these redup. binoms. But since both [\*TSUJ(-TSUJ)]{.IPA}{.sc}{.translower} and [\*ŊUJ(-ŊUJ)]{.IPA}{.sc}{.translower} have separate attestations in pre-Qín use, it's conceivable that this is not an inseparable binom but two synonyms used in tandem that happen to rhyme.

[2.3](#2-3){style="font-family:var(--monospace);"}{id="2-3"}{class="section-head"}&emsp;Probably imilar is the (pseudo-?) binom in parallel position in the next line, [虺隤]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*hrˤuj-lˤuj]{.IPA} ^[My system of OC initials is basically the same as that of Schuessler's, with pharyngealization following Baxter and Sagart. <span class="IPA">\*h-</span> here is essentially equivalent to B&S's <span class="IPA">\*qʰ-</span>.] (W. "stagger"; K. "all exhausted"), which M. glosses as [病也]{lang="zh-Hant"} "ill, sick". [虺]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*hrˤuj]{.IPA} is perhaps related to [壞]{lang="zh-Hant"}, [瘣]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*gˤrujs]{.IPA} "ill, sick" (Shī 197) (< "destroyed"?) ^[B&S reconstructs <span class="IPA">\*\[r̥\]ˤu\[j\]</span> for this item <span lang="zh-Hant">虺</span>, considering it to be cognate to <span lang="zh-Hant">儽</span> <span class="IPA">*\[r\]ˤuj-s</span> "exhausted" (2014: 116)], and [隤]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*lˤuj]{.IPA} can stand as a morpheme on its own that means "to collapse". 

[2.4](#2-4){style="font-family:var(--monospace);"}{id="2-4"}{class="section-head"}&emsp;A tangent on the reconstruction of the item [隤]{lang="zh-Hant"} [lˤuj]{.IPA} and the [貴]{lang="zh-Hant"} series in general. One could divide this series into three parts: (1) items with posterior MC initials, e.g [貴]{lang="zh-Hant"} *kjw+jH* "precious", [饋]{lang="zh-Hant"} *gwijH* "to provide with food", [匱]{lang="zh-Hant"} *gwijH* "box"; ^[A sidenote here: the item <span lang="zh-Hant">靧</span> B&S cite on (2014: 101) (their reconstruction: <span class="IPA">\*qʰˤuj-s</span> > *xwojH*, "wash the face") is troublesome since it has some early palaeographic evidence that seems to point to <span class="IPA">\*m̥ˤ-</span>, and the orthographic form inherited by received texts <span lang="zh-Hant">靧</span> is then dubious (perhaps a late invention after the loss of voiceless resonants). It also happens that if we remove <span lang="zh-Hant">靧</span> *xwojH* herefrom, there is no longer any item with *x*- in this series. ] (2) items with the *y*- initial—the only common and reliably pre-Qín ones are [遺]{lang="zh-Hant"} *ywij* "to leave behind" and [遺]{lang="zh-Hant"} *ywijH* "to gift" (also note [壝]{lang="zh-Hant"} *ywijX* "low walls that enclose e.g. a sacrificial altar" \[*Zhōulǐ*, *Yìzhōushū*\] and [肥𧔥]{lang="zh-Hant"} *bj+j-ywij* some sort of mythical snake monster \[*Shānhǎijīng*\]); (3) items with MC coronal plosives—the only reliably pre-Qín one is [隤]{lang="zh-Hant"}, [僓]{lang="zh-Hant"}, [穨]{lang="zh-Hant"}, [頹]{lang="zh-Hant"}, etc., *dwoj* "to collapse". Both Baxter & Sagart and Schuessler (the latter I'm not entirely sure about) seem to try to put (1) and (2) in the same series and deny (3) to have had pre-Qín XS contact with either (1) or (2) (both follow Karlgren in this division): 

| item | inherited ortho. | B&S (2014) | Sch. (2009) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| \[*kjw+jH* "precious"\] | ([貴]{lang="zh-Hant"}) | [\*kuj-s]{.IPA} | [\*kwəs]{.IPA} |
| \[*gwijH* "to provide with food"\] | ([饋]{lang="zh-Hant"}) | [\*\[g\]ruj-s]{.IPA} | [\*gus]{.IPA} |
| \[*gwijH* "box"\] | ([匱]{lang="zh-Hant"}) | [\*\[g\]ruj-s]{.IPA} | [\*gus]{.IPA} | 
| \[*ywij* "to leave behind"\] | ([遺]{lang="zh-Hant"}) | [\*\[ɢ\]\(r\)uj]{.IPA} | [\*wi]{.IPA} |
| \[*ywijH* "to gift"\] | ([遺]{lang="zh-Hant"}) | [\*\[ɢ\]\(r\)uj-s]{.IPA} | [\*wih]{.IPA} |
| \[*dwoj* "to collapse"\] | ([隤]{lang="zh-Hant"}) | [\*N-rˤuj]{.IPA} | [\*dûi]{.IPA} |

B&S's reconstruction for [隤]{lang="zh-Hant"} obviously tries to link it to [儽]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*\[r\]ˤuj-s]{.IPA} "exhausted" (see B&S 2014: 116).

In the AHU bamboo slip version the Máo-text [隤]{lang="zh-Hant"} in this line is written as what the scribers of the Warring-States Chǔ slips had usually used to write [遺]{lang="zh-Hant"} \[*ywij* "to leave behind"\]; \[*ywijH* "to gift"\]—basically rendering the division above invalid. In fact, it has been noted (e.g. in <a href="http://www.fdgwz.org.cn/Web/Show/384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Zhào Tóng [趙彤]{lang="zh-Hant"}, 2008, in Mandarin</a>) that the Warring-States Chǔ scribers used one phonetic element for (1), and another, completely different phonetic element for (2) and (3) (all images in the table below except the last one are taken from `www.kaom.net`): 

| item | inherited ortho. | Chǔ slips ortho. |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

This seems to me strong evidence that (2) and (3) were in one series distinct from (1) (the merger of the two to one single series is probably due to graphic confusion in the Qín lineage of the script):

[2.5](#2-5){style="font-family:var(--monospace);"}{id="2-5"}{class="section-head"}&emsp;The word [玄黃]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*gʷˤin-gʷˤaŋ]{.IPA} is usually taken to be a compound of [玄]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*gʷˤin]{.IPA} "dark-coloured" and [黃]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*gʷˤaŋ]{.IPA} "yellow". Indeed in other early attestations [玄黃]{lang="zh-Hant"} typically refers to colours, especially associated with those of the sky and the earth (*Yìjīng*: [天玄而地黃]{lang="zh-Hant"} "Heaven's (colour) is azure and earth's is yellow", trans. James Legge). The instance of [玄黃]{lang="zh-Hant"} in this Shī, which is used to describe sick and exhausted horses, and—since it appears in parallel position with [虺隤]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*hrˤuj-lˤuj]{.IPA} "sick, ill" in st. 2 and [瘏]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*dˤa]{.IPA} "sick, ill" (also cf. Shī 155) in st. 4—itself must mean something like "sick, ill", has no obvious parallel use cases elsewhere ^[Arguably Shī 234 st.1 <span lang="zh-Hant">何草不黃</span> and st.2 <span lang="zh-Hant">何草不玄</span> (W: "What plant is not faded?" "What plant is not wilting?" K.: "What plant is not yellow" "What plant is not dark") could be read as both <span lang="zh-Hant">玄</span> and <span lang="zh-Hant">黃</span> meaning "ill, sick"; the first to make this point, I think, was Wáng Yǐnzhī <span lang="zh-Hant">王引之</span> (1766&ndash;1834). In the opposite direction, one could also argue for something like "(of a plant) yellow and dark" > "(of a plant) faded and wilting" > "(in general) ill, sick, wasting away" to explain how <span lang="zh-Hant">玄黃</span> gained the meaning, although I haven't seen anyone make this particular case.] and is very confusing. M. gloss: [玄馬病則黃]{lang="zh-Hant"} "when dark-coloured horses fall ill, they turn yellow." Zhū Xī [朱熹]{lang="zh-Hant"} elaborates: [玄黃，玄馬而黃，病極而變色也]{lang="zh-Hant"} "[\*gʷˤin-gʷˤaŋ]{.IPA} means that the horses, orinally dark, turn yellow. This change of colour is a result of extreme illness." I'm *really* not knowledgeable in equine illnesses enough to evaluate the plausibility of this, ^[One point should be raised that (I think the first to mention this was Chén Huàn <span lang="zh-Hant">陳奐</span> 1786&ndash;1863) the M. gloss <span lang="zh-Hant">玄馬病則黃</span> might actually be a scribal error of <span lang="zh-Hant">馬病則玄黃</span> "when horses fall ill, they become <span class="IPA">\*gʷˤin-gʷˤaŋ</span>", thus parallel in terms of sentence structure to the M. gloss <span lang="zh-Hant">馬勞則喘息</span> "when horses grow tired, they wheeze for breath" under Shī 162.] but K. must have been incredulous, since his explanation is not pathological: "black-streaked with sweat and yellow with dust; the par. with st. 2 shows that *hüan-huang* ‘black and yellow’ does not mean the horse’s natural colour, but is a result of their labour." 

Alternative explanations have been offered. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3ANLC416-09jh004968-47510_%E8%81%9E%E4%B8%80%E5%A4%9A%E5%85%A8%E9%9B%86.pdf&page=586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="wikimedia-commons">Wén Yīduō [聞一多]{lang="zh-Hant"} (1948, vol.2: 113&ndash;114, in Literary Chinese)</a> proposed that [玄黃]{lang="zh-Hant"} refers not to the colours of the horses, but to the colours that the horses *see*: in exhaustion the horses' vision blurs, no longer seeing things but only colours. He also tries to connect [玄黃]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*gʷˤin-gʷˤaŋ]{.IPA} to [眩眃]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*gʷˤinʔ-gˤunʔ]{.IPA}? > *hwenX-hwonX* "(of eyesight) blurred". <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/672705324" class="worldcat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gāo Hēng [高亨]{lang="zh-Hant"} (1957: 12, in Literary Chinese)</a> tentatively proposed that [玄黃]{lang="zh-Hant"} here could mean "sweating profusely", connecting it to [泫]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*gʷˤin]{.IPA} "(usually of tears) to flow down" and [潢]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*gʷˤaŋ]{.IPA} "(of a body of water) great and deep". I don't think a convincing case is made with either of those explanations. Other than the fact that something was wrong with the horses, I'm still not sure what [玄黃]{lang="zh-Hant"} means here.

## stanza 4

[陟彼砠矣，我馬瘏矣，我僕痡矣。云何吁矣]{lang="zh-Hant"}

- [Waley]{.sc}: *I am climbing that shale; my horses founder, my groom is stricken. Oh, woe, oh, misery!*

[3.1](#3-1){style="font-family:var(--monospace);"}{id="3-1"}{class="section-head"}&emsp;[吁]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*m̥(r)a]{.IPA} > *xju*, M. gloss [吁，憂也]{lang="zh-Hant"} "[\*m̥(r)a]{.IPA} means 'pained, anxious'" (also see Shī 199 [云何其盱]{lang="zh-Hant"} and 225 [云何盱矣]{lang="zh-Hant"}; this [盱]{lang="zh-Hant"} very likely writes the same word, though M. gloss at 199 for [盱]{lang="zh-Hant"} is different: [病也]{lang="zh-Hant"} "sick, ill"). The orthographic form [吁]{lang="zh-Hant"} in the Máo text points XS wise to [\*hʷ(r)a]{.IPA} > *xju* (B&S: [\*qʷʰ(r)a]{.IPA} "pained"). This item has, based on the Máo orthography, been equated with [于]{lang="zh-Hant"}, [吁]{lang="zh-Hant"} [\*hʷ(r)a]{.IPA} an exclamation (> "to sigh, to lament") since Zhū Xī. But the version on AHU bamboo slips writes this word with [無]{lang="zh-Hant"}—this points to an OC form with original [\*m̥-]{.IPA}, which must have merged with original [\*hʷ-]{.IPA} by the time of Máo; the Máo orthography must have reflected the post-merger phonology, and identification with the exclam. is probably not valid then. This has been noted by [Zhāng Fùhǎi <span lang="zh-Hant">張富海</span> (2024 \[2022\], in Mandarin)](http://www.fdgwz.org.cn/Web/Show/11101).
